# GmailSheetSender
Google Sheets template to send emails to your customers/community


Pending ideas:
- Make from & to emails a variable
- Create a config page in the sheets to define everything
- Create html templates (at least one)
- Create support for any other inputs rather tan HTML (google docs, gmail template?) - See yetanothermailmerge
- Add support for attachments
- Is it possible to add if the email was opened?
- Add support for any custom field (any column can be referenced by his first row text)
- Add support for @gmail.com accounts (less emails per hour and per day)
- TBC
